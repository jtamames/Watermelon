## Requirements

### System dependencies

If you are installing inside a **conda environment** you may get errors about `knitr`, `rmarkdown`, `xfun`, `highr`, `htmlwidgets` or `DT` failing to compile from source. The most reliable fix is to use the Posit Package Manager (RSPM), which provides precompiled R binaries for Linux and avoids all compilation issues:

**Ubuntu 20.04 (focal):**
```r
options(repos = c(RSPM = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/__linux__/focal/latest"))
install.packages(c("xfun", "highr", "knitr", "rmarkdown", "htmlwidgets", "DT"))
```

**Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy):**
```r
options(repos = c(RSPM = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/__linux__/jammy/latest"))
install.packages(c("xfun", "highr", "knitr", "rmarkdown", "htmlwidgets", "DT"))
```

To check your Ubuntu version: `lsb_release -cs`

This downloads precompiled binaries instead of compiling from source, bypassing all system library dependency issues. After running the above, proceed with the regular `install.packages` commands below.

### R (≥ 4.1)

Install the required R packages:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "shiny",
  "shinyjs",
  "shinyFiles",
  "bslib",
  "DT"
))
```

Install **SQMtools** from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("SQMtools")
```

Or install the latest development version from the SqueezeMeta repository:

```r
install.packages(
  "/path/to/SqueezeMeta/lib/SQMtools",
  repos = NULL,
  type  = "source"
)
```

### plotly (optional, required for function heatmaps in Plots tab)

```r
install.packages("plotly")
```

### vegan (optional, required for Multivariate tab)

```r
install.packages("vegan")
```

### pathview (optional, required for Pathways tab)

`pathview` is a Bioconductor package that downloads and annotates KEGG pathway maps. It also installs `KEGGREST` as a dependency.

```r
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("pathview")
```

The Pathways tab requires an **internet connection** at generation time — `pathview` downloads the pathway map image from the KEGG servers on each run.

`ggpattern` and `magick` are **not required**. SQMxplore generates its own inline color scale legend. Do not attempt to install `ggpattern` — it depends on `sf` → `s2` / `units`, which require system GIS libraries (GDAL, PROJ) that are rarely available in conda environments.

### KronaTools (optional, required for Krona tab)

If SqueezeMeta is already installed in your environment, KronaTools is likely already available — check before installing:

```bash
which ktImportText
```

If it prints a path, no further action is needed. SQMxplore detects it automatically.

If it is not available, install it manually (recommended over conda if you are having network issues):

```bash
wget https://github.com/marbl/Krona/releases/download/v2.8.1/KronaTools-2.8.1.tar.gz
tar xzf KronaTools-2.8.1.tar.gz
cd KronaTools-2.8.1
./install.pl --prefix ~/.local
ktUpdateTaxonomy.sh
```

Or via conda if your network allows it:

```bash
conda install -c bioconda krona
ktUpdateTaxonomy.sh
```

---

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtamames/SQMxplore.git
cd SQMxplore
```

---

## Usage

Launch the app from R:

```r
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
Rscript -e 'shiny::runApp("app.R")'
```

**If you get a `'browser' must be a non-empty character string` error** (common on servers or SSH sessions without a desktop environment), disable the automatic browser launch:

```r
shiny::runApp("app.R", launch.browser = FALSE)
```

To make the app accessible from another machine on the network:

```r
shiny::runApp("app.R", host = "0.0.0.0", port = 3838, launch.browser = FALSE)
```

Then open `http://<server-ip>:3838` in your local browser.

### Loading a project

1. Go to the **Project** tab
2. Click **Select directory** and choose your SqueezeMeta project directory
3. The app will auto-detect the project type from `creator.txt`:
   - **SqueezeMeta projects** (created with `SqueezeMeta.pl`): point to the project root directory
   - **SQMlite projects** (created with `sqm2tables.py`, `sqmreads2tables.py` or `combine-sqm-tables.py`): point to the tables directory
4. Click **Load**

If the tables directory cannot be detected automatically, a manual directory selector will appear.

## Project types

| Type | Load function | Features |
|------|--------------|----------|
| SQM (full) | `loadSQM` | All tabs, all plots, taxonomy/function search, bins |
| SQMlite | `loadSQMlite` | Plots, Tables, Krona, Pathways, Multivariate; no contig/ORF/bin detail; no subset functions |

---

## Tabs

### Project
Displays a structured summary of the loaded project: sample list, read counts, contig and ORF statistics, taxonomic classification coverage, most abundant taxa per rank.

### Plots
Select a plot type from the sidebar:
- **Taxonomy (barplot)** — choose rank, count type, number of taxa; optionally search for specific taxa (SQM full only)
- **COG / KEGG / PFAM functions** — heatmap of most abundant functions; optionally search by ID or keyword
- **Binning** — barplot of most abundant bins

All plots support adjustable width, height and font size. Changes apply immediately. Use **Download PNG** to export.

### Tables
Four independent category selectors:
- **Assembly** — Contigs table, ORFs table (SQM full only)
- **Taxonomy** — select rank and metric (percentages, raw abundances)
- **Functions** — select database and metric (raw abundances, percentages, base counts, CPM, TPM, copy number); COG and KEGG tables include Name and Path annotation columns
- **Bins** — bins summary table (SQM full only)

Taxonomy and function tables include a **Filter samples** selector. Use **Download CSV** to export the current view.

### Krona
Generates an interactive Krona taxonomy chart using `exportKrona` from SQMtools and `ktImportText` from KronaTools. Optionally filter by sample before generating. The chart is displayed inline and can be downloaded as a self-contained HTML file.

### Pathways
Overlays KEGG functional abundance data onto pathway maps using `exportPathway` from SQMtools (a wrapper for the `pathview` Bioconductor package). Requires an internet connection.

- **Pathway browser** — hierarchical tree organised by the 6 top-level KEGG categories (Metabolism, Genetic Information Processing, Environmental Information Processing, Cellular Processes, Organismal Systems, Human Diseases), with subcategories and search filter
- **Count type** — copy number, TPM, raw abundances, percentages, or base counts
- **Mode** — all samples together (multi-colour map), one PNG per sample, or log2 fold-change between two groups of samples
- **Legend** — inline color scale bar per sample, built from the same parameters used to generate the map
- **Download** — exports all generated PNGs as a zip file

### Multivariate
Ordination analysis on taxonomy or functional abundance data. Requires the `vegan` R package.

**Analysis types:**

- **PCA** — Principal Component Analysis via `vegan::rda()`. Displays a biplot with sample scores and feature loadings (arrows). The percentage of variance explained by each axis is shown on the axis labels. Optionally show feature labels on arrow tips.
- **NMDS** — Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling via `vegan::metaMDS()`. Displays sample scores with the stress value annotated on the plot.

**Data options:**
- **Data type** — taxonomy (any rank) or functions (any database: COG, KEGG, PFAM, external)
- **Metric** — any available count type (raw abundances, percentages, TPM, copy number, etc.)
- **Number of features** — uses the N most abundant features (by mean across samples)
- **Exclude Unclassified** — removes rows labelled Unclassified, Unmapped or No database
- **Exclude ambiguous taxa** — removes any row whose name starts with "unclassified" (e.g. "unclassified Pseudomonadota")

**Normalization (PCA only):**
- **CLR** — centered log-ratio with pseudocount +1; the recommended option for compositional metagenomics data
- **Log10** — log10(x + 1); useful when preserving relative scale
- **Raw** — no transformation; suitable for data already normalized (TPM, percentages). Note: may cause PC1 to reflect sequencing depth rather than community composition

**Distance (NMDS only):**
- **Bray-Curtis** — standard ecological distance on proportions; recommended for most metagenomics datasets
- **Jaccard** — presence/absence version of Bray-Curtis
- **Hellinger** — square root of relative abundances followed by Euclidean distance; reduces the influence of dominant features
- **Euclidean** — Euclidean distance on raw counts

**Quality warnings** are displayed below the plot when:
- Only 2 samples (PCA is trivial)
- PC1 explains >90% of variance (nearly one-dimensional data)
- PC1+PC2 explain <50% of variance (limited representation)
- PC1+PC2 explain <30% of variance (poor representation)
- Raw normalization selected (risk of sequencing depth artefact)
- NMDS stress <0.01 (too few samples for meaningful ordination)
- NMDS stress >0.2 (ordination may not be reliable)
